# physiognomy
All hail god of physiognomy! Long live physiognomy, the king of all pseudosciences! I praise him when I run out of research ideas and desperately need a publication. I give thanks to him for providing a theoretical framework to cite when I lack contributions in my articles. I am truly grateful for his help in inventing more snake oils! Yes, all kinds of snake oils... Criminality detection, sexual orientation detection, political orientation detection, personality detection and more! All using the cheap and available facial images... I want to drown in your blessings and anointing! Anoint me with more publications! More research grants! More consulting money! More talks and conferences! More publicity! Hallelujah! To the god of physiognomy be the glory and praise forever and ever!
